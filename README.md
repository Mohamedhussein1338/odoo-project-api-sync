ProjectApi Odoo Module

This repository contains an Odoo module named ProjectApi, which facilitates communication between two Odoo instances (Odoo 15 and Odoo 16). Upon creating a record in Odoo 15, this module sends the data to an endpoint in Odoo 16 using a POST request. It demonstrates how to implement inter-instance communication in Odoo using Python requests and the Odoo framework.

Features:

   1-Creates records in Odoo 15 and synchronizes them with Odoo 16 in real-time.

   
   2-Utilizes Python requests library for making HTTP POST requests.
